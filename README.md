#  TalentScout - Intelligent Hiring Assistant

TalentScout is a smart, interactive hiring assistant built using **Streamlit** and powered by **Google's Gemini API**. It helps recruiters automatically screen tech candidates by generating tailored technical questions based on their profile.

##  Project Overview

TalentScout is built to:

* Greet and guide candidates through a conversational flow
* Collect candidate details (name, contact, experience, tech stack, etc.)
* Dynamically generate **beginner to advanced level technical questions** based on the candidate's tech stack
* Ask **questions one-by-one**, just like a real interviewer
* Handle conversation context and flow smoothly
* Support **skip and exit** options gracefully
* Save anonymized candidate responses for later review

##  Usage Guide

1. Launch the app using the command above.
2. The chatbot will greet the candidate and present a **privacy notice**.
3. The candidate will be asked for:

   * Full name
   * Email
   * Phone number
   * Years of experience
   * Desired position
   * Current location
   * Tech stack
4. Based on the input, **technical questions** are generated dynamically using a prompt to a language model.
5. Questions are asked **one by one**, and the candidate can:

   * Answer
   * Skip
   * Exit anytime
6. After the final question, the bot gracefully **thanks the candidate** and ends the session.
7. Data is securely stored via the `data_handler.py` utility.

##  Prompt Design

Prompts are structured to:

1. Collect clear user input (e.g., name, email, tech stack).
2. Construct a **customized prompt** using `prompt.py` for dynamic technical question generation:

   * Categorize questions from beginner â†’ intermediate â†’ advanced.
   * Focused on candidateâ€™s specified tools, frameworks, or languages.
3. Ensure instructions like "Ask one question at a time", "Vary question complexity", and "Avoid repeating similar types" are embedded in the prompt.

## ðŸ§— Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                               | Solution                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repeated technical questions**        | Enforced uniqueness via better prompt engineering and filtering.                         |
| **Too-short or vague responses**        | Added minimum response length checks and encouraged more detailed answers.               |
| **Broken flow when skipping questions** | Built confirmation logic before skipping and managed skipped state.                      |
| **Session context loss**                | Used `st.session_state` to track the complete flow and user data.                        |
| **UI responsiveness issues**            | Applied consistent styling via injected CSS for mobile-friendliness and desktop support. |
| **Conversation State Management**        |Implemented Streamlit session state with nested dictionaries                             |                                             |
| **Inconsistent technical question difficulty**|Created tiered prompt templates with difficulty parameters                          |                                                  |
| **API failures breaking conversation**   | Added  fallback handling                                                                |
